;5.9 Question 10
Fib proc USES rax rbx rcx rdx	;sets the loop counter from value in rax
	mov rcx,rax
	mov rax,1
	mov rbx,0
	mov rdx,0
L1:
	ADD rax,rbx					;fib number stored in rax
	ADD rax,rdx					;rbx is previous number
	;call WriteInt64		
	MOV rdx,rbx					;rdx is 2nd previous number
	MOV rbx,rax
	mov rax,0
	loop L1
