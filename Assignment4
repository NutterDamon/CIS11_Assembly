Use the following data for Questions 1-5:
.data
val1 BYTE 10h
val2 WORD 8000h
val3 DWORD 0FFFFh
val4 WORD 7FFFh

- [ ] 4.2.8 Section Review, Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6	 
1. Write an instruction that increments val2
  inc val2
2. Write an instruction that subtracts val3 from EAX.
  sub eax,val3
3. Write instructions that subtract val4 from val2
  mov eax,val2
  sub eax,val4
  mov val2,eax
4. If val2 is incremented by 1 using the ADD instruction, what will be the values of the Carry
and Sign flags?
CF =  SF = 
5. If val4 is incremented by 1 using the ADD instruction, what will be the values of the Overflow
and Sign flags?
OF =  SF = 
6. Where indicated, write down the values of the Carry, Sign, Zero, and Overflow flags after
each instruction has executed:
mov ax,7FF0h
add al,10h ; a. CF = SF = ZF = OF =
add ah,1 ; b. CF = SF = ZF = OF =
add ax,2 ; c. CF = SF = ZF = OF =
