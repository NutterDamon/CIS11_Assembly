- [ ] 2.1.5 Section Review, Questions 1,2,3,4 and 5
1. The central processor unit (CPU) contains registers and what other basic elements?
  The CPU contains registers, a clock, a control unit, and an ALU.
2. The central processor unit is connected to the rest of the computer system using what three
buses?
  The CPU is connected to the rest of the computer system by using the data bus, control bus, and address bus.
3. Why does memory access take more machine cycles than register access?
  Memory access takes more machine cycles because there are wait states accosiated with the difference in the 
  speeds of the cpu, bus, and memory circuits.
4. What are the three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle?
The three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle are Fetch, Decode, and Execute.
5. Which two additional steps are required in the instruction execution cycle when a memory
operand is used?

5. What is the purpose of the 8259A PIC controller?

- [ ] 2.5.2 Section Review, Questions 1, 3, 4, and 5
1. Of the four levels of input/output in a computer system, which is the most universal and
portable?
3. Why are device drivers necessary, given that the BIOS already has code that communicates
with the computer’s hardware?
4. In the example regarding displaying a string of characters, which level exists between the
operating system and the video controller card?
5. Is it likely that the BIOS for a computer running MS-Windows would be different from that
used by a computer running Linux?

- [ ] 2.8 Review Question 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 19, 20, 25, and 26
7. Which part of the CPU performs floating-point arithmetic?
8. On a 32-bit processor, how many bits are contained in each floating-point data register?
9. (True/False): The x86-64 instruction set is backward-compatible with the x86 instruction set.
10. (True/False): In current 64-bit chip implementations, all 64 bits are used for addressing.
12. (True/False): Static RAM is usually less expensive than dynamic RAM.
19. (True/False): A bus is a plastic cable that is attached to the motherboard at both ends, but
does not sit directly on the motherboard.
20. (True/False): CMOS RAM is the same as static RAM, meaning that it holds its value with-
out any extra power or refresh cycles.
25. At which level(s) can an assembly language program manipulate input/output?
26. Why do game programs often send their sound output directly to the sound card’s hardware
ports?
